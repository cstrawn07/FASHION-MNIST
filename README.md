# FASHION-MNIST
The dataset being used in this project I the is the FASHION MNIST dataset which contains 28x28 pixel images of T-shirts, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots that are assigned a numerical value from 0 to 9. 

There should be three files turned in for this project.

Project_Code-Data.ipynb
Project_Code-V4.ipynb
Project_Code-V5.ipynb


Project_Code-Data.ipynb
This code as some simple analysis of the data type and some graphs the distribution of values within the test and
training data. There really isn't much in this code and was basically seperated from V4 and V5 code so it would make
it look messy.

Project_Code-V4.ipynb
This is very similar to the code provided in class with some changes to the hyper parameters. This code has comments on what I changed 
or added when compared with the original. This stores a good chunk of the graphs I used for the report as well as some other graphs
that didnt end up in the report

Project_Code-V5.ipynb
This code specifically is for running the Tanh version of the ReLU block of code found in V4 so there is nothing really new in terms of code
functionality when comparing it to the ReLU version from V4. The only advantage to seperating this out, was that I could run V4 and V5 at the 
same time.
